2. **Open Locally**: Place `index.html` and `styles.css` in the same directory, then open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. **Host Online** (Optional): Upload the files to a web server (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for public access.

## Customization
1. **Images**:
   - Replace placeholder image sources in `index.html` with your assets:
     - `hero-bg.jpg`: Hero background.
     - `app-store.png`, `google-play.png`, `qr-code.png`: Download buttons and QR code.
     - `app-overview.png`, `screenshot1.png`, `screenshot2.png`, `screenshot3.png`: App visuals.
     - `download-icon.png`, `setup-icon.png`, `compete-icon.png`: How It Works icons.
     - `twitter.png`, `instagram.png`: Social media icons.
2. **Links**:
   - Update `href="#"` attributes with actual URLs:
     - App store links in the hero section.
     - Footer links (`Contact Us`, `Privacy Policy`, `Terms of Use`, social media).
3. **Content**:
   - Edit text in `index.html` (e.g., hero headline, testimonials) to match your branding.
4. **Styling**:
   - Modify `styles.css` to change colors (e.g., `#007bff` for headings), fonts, or spacing.

## Usage
- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview the landing page locally.
- Replace placeholders and test responsiveness on different devices.

## Notes
- No JavaScript is included; add libraries like Slick Carousel for interactive features (e.g., screenshot slider) if desired.
- Ensure all image paths are correct after replacement to avoid broken visuals.
